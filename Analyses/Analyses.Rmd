## Main anlayses undertaken in this project 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Main analyses 
The following outlines the main analyses run in this project 

1. Landvr: 
2. Cleaning and formatting dates in the NHM and CSIP datasets
3. Binding the 2 datasets (NHM + CSIP first, followed by IWDG which was aquired at a later date, see **02-cleaning-and-adding-irish-data.Rmd**)

## Load libraries/packages
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```



## Data download 

The NHM data can be directly downloaded from: 
[nhm.ac.uk/data](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/8c67d782-c01d-4807-8913-f57d0daabf35) 

The CSIP data can be downloaded by going to: 
[ukstrandings.org](http://ukstrandings.org/)

We saved these two datasets as "EDITNHMdata.csv" and "EDITCSIPdata.csv", respectively. This how they are named hereafter.
