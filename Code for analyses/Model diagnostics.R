#Ellen - The gelman.diag gives you the scale reduction factors for each parameter. 
#Approximate convergence is diagnosed when the upper limit is close to 1. 
#A factor of 1 means that between variance and within chain variance are equal. 
#Larger values mean that there is still a notable difference between chains. 
#A values of 1.1 or below is generally accepted. 

#Look at the convergence of the chains - one chain is red, one is black
gelman.plot((mychains))
#Iterations of the two chains (should overlay one another for good convergence)
